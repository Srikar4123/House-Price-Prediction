**House Price Prediction Project**

This project implements a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, lot area, and other factors. This project predicts the price based on parameters in th multiple linear regressionHere’s an overview of the project:

Project Overview
Objective: Predict house prices using machine learning techniques.
Features: The model considers features like the number of rooms, location, area, and other relevant factors.
Steps:
Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand variable distributions and relationships.
Feature Selection: Identify significant features impacting house prices.
Model Training and Optimization: Optimize the model using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search/Random Search).
Model Evaluation: Assess performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².
Deployment: Deploy the model via a Streamlit application, allowing users to input data and receive predictions.
