**House Price Prediction Project**

This project implements a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, lot area, and other factors. This project predicts the price based on parameters in the multiple linear regression and generates a graph which shows us the relationship between the price of the house and the other parameters that influence the price. Here’s an overview of the project:

**Project Overview**

**Objective:**
            Predict house prices using machine learning techniques.
            
**Features:**
        The model considers features like the number of rooms, location, area, and other relevant factors.
        
**Steps:**

⚔️**Data Exploration:** Analyze the dataset to understand variable distributions and relationships.
  
⚔️**Feature Selection:** Identify significant features impacting house prices.
  
⚔️**Model Training:** Train the model based on the data chosen.
  
⚔️**Model Evaluation:** Assess performance using metrics like MSE.
  
⚔️**Deployment:** Deploy the model via a Streamlit application, allowing users to input data and receive predictions.


**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed:

😊 Python (version 3.6 or higher)

😊 Jupyter Notebook (for data exploration and model development)

😊 Required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

**Models Utilized**

**Linear Regression:**

**->** Linear regression establishes the relationship between two variables. It is one of the most common techniques in regression analysis.

**->** In linear regression, there are only two variables:

 The dependent variable (also called the response variable or target variable), denoted as y. The independent variable (also called the predictor variable or feature), denoted as x.


**->** The relationship is graphically depicted using a straight line (linear equation). The slope of this line defines how a change in the independent variable impacts the dependent variable.

**->** The y-intercept represents the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is 0.


**Multiple Linear Regression:**

**->** Multiple regression is a broader class of regression analysis that includes both linear and nonlinear regressions.

**->** It incorporates multiple independent variables (features) to predict the dependent variable.

**->** Each independent variable has its own coefficient to ensure proper weighting.

**->** The formula for multiple linear regression is:
                        **y=β0​+β1​x1​+β2​x2​+…+βn​xn​**
